Welcome to the Whats new thing!
This might be handy if you wanna know whats new
But who knows?

Date of changes: M6 / D8 / Y2024

Changes / Whats new:
    - Removed BHelp or BetterHelp because it's useless
    - Removed the fakeload because again it's useless
    - Removed echo for now (Might return soon?)
    / Changed the \ to / in the console
    / reworked all the commands that are useful
    + Added an launcher / starter! To check if all files are there
    + Added an Setup to show how this program works
    + Added an feature where setup will create an file for skipping setup
    + Added an recovery menu for well if PyPrompt doesn't exist (in the setup)
    + Forgot to mention that there's also an setting to delete the setup file

What i should add in the future:
    (Check!) That all the commands work without having to keep the program in the same folder or keeping it the same name
