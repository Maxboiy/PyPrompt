Welcome to the Whats new thing!
This might be handy if you wanna know whats new
But who knows?

Date of changes: M5 / D10 / Y2024

Changes / Whats new:
    + Added a icon! (WOW SO COOL!!)
    + Added a warning for people to know that i suck so much at programming that if they rename or move something it will break
    / Changed the WN and BHelp commands to a lower case command 
    / The version numbers will from now on be like 1.X instead of 1.X.X
    / Changed the command quit to exit
    / Put a bit more space between the command and the context in the help menu
    / Changed the name load to fakeload
    / Also changed the C:/> to #\> as its something more orignal
    - Sadly discontinued the lunix version (Sorry! :( )
    - Got rid of the run.bat file as it was replaced my the .exe file
    
Scrapyard:
    - Wanted to add a feature where theres a cursor a like a white block like what they have in terminal 
      but it didn't want to work in VSCode so that idea is scraped!

What i should add in the future:
    That all the commands work without having to keep the program in the same folder or keeping it the same name
